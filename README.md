DISCLAIMER: The original file was written as a Jupyter Notebook, however a Python file is also attached as it allows for easy preview of the written code (which is not provided by the Notebook).

A Jupyter Notebook that encompasses a description of a study and Python code used to analyse information for testing the hypotheses of the study. 
The study aimed to find out whether news articles' sentiment value differed in election years (years when a presidential election took place)
in comparison with non-election years. Furthermore, it was of interest whether this contrast was comparable between the United States and Poland.

For the purpose of the study, data from the Global Database of Events, Language, and Tone Project (GDELT Project) were used, i.e.
news article sentiment value (positive, negative and compound) gathered from years from 2017 to 2024. 

This data was plotted over a lineplot for a visual interpretation of how it changed across all years and over a simple plot of its mean change
between election and non-electioni years. 
Furthermore, statistical tests were used to find out whether the changes were signficant and LDA topic modeling was carried out web-scraped headlines 
of all articles, to find out whether covered topics by the news differed between election and non-election years.
